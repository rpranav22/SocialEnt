        <h3 id="markdown">Introduction</h3>

        <p>The aim of the final project in this course was to identify a social issue and attempt to create something that would go some way towards improving the situation either by finding a solution or by raising awareness regarding this cause in some form or the other. As a group we decided to pick a field in which our project could make some sort of difference considering the time constraints (The course is only three months long). Our second criteria was to pick a project which would reflect our strengths, as this would allow us to create something which had the potential for the greatest impact. All 3 of us have a background in Computer Science and felt that we could use these skills and attempt to create a useful web application which could solve any of the array of social issues around us. We brainstormed ideas and finally managed to narrow down to the field of women’s safety, which we feel is easily one of the most pertinent issues in our country today. It seemed to be the ideal opportunity for us to gain some in depth knowledge regarding the issues faced by women on a daily basis and to try our level best to help them in any manner we could.</p>

        <h3>Interviews</h3>

        <p>TOur next step was to contact NGOs who actively worked in the field of women’s issues, including their safety. We got in touch with 2 NGO’s - Swati and Jagori - to get an idea of what the challenges in the field were and received advice as to how we should set about our task. They told us about the severe lack of information regarding safety levels of different areas and explained how this left women feeling vulnerable especially while travelling on their own to unfamiliar areas. These interviews gave us an insight into the unique challenges in the field as well as what was lacking in terms of the current solutions. They gave us a foundation upon which we could build begin to build an app that could answer these problems.

After this round of interviews, we did some research to find whether there were any companies who had succeeded in implementing anything along similar lines. We came across a company called Safetipin which is a highly successful women’s safety app and decided to get in touch with them. After multiple attempts, we were able to get hold of a senior representative of Safetipin to understand how they approached the challenges in the field. They explained to us how they undertook extensive amounts of qualitative research to come up with a list of metrics, a weighted average of which would give a safety score. These metrics include factors such as visibility, crowdedness, lighting etc. We told them about our project and they were enthusiastic to help us and happy that students were showing interest in their work. They decided to help us out by providing us with access to their Delhi area-wise data of different metrics and requested us to present our project to them once it was complete.

        <h3>HYPOTHESIS: Is there a relationship between suicides committed with respect to the person’s gender, geographical location and their respective socio-economic factors?</h2>

        <h4 id = "one">Surveys<a href="#main_content_wrap"> UP</a></h4>

        <p>To meaningfully use the raw data they had provided us with, we had to arrive at an algorithm which would give us the safety score consisting of a weighted average of all the metrics. For the purpose of beginning work on our app, we decided to run a small informal survey with the women at Ashoka, discussing the importance of the different metrics in the list. As the project progressed however, we sent out a larger formal survey and received over 80 responses. These responses were then compiled, processed and the metrics were given a weightage rank between 1-5 in order of importance. This weightage rank was then applied to our algorithm and we managed to extract area wise safety scores from the raw data.
</p>


        <h4 id = "two">Our Application<a href="#main_content_wrap">UP</a></h4>
        <p>Once we had raw data and managed to process it to extract safety scores, we were able to begin proper work on our application. For the purpose of this course we decided to make a web application which would include 2 primary features:
          <ul>
            <li>A Data Visualisation of a map of Delhi which contains an area wise breakdown of safety scores as well as scores of each area according to particular metrics. </li>
            <li>An SOS feature</li>
        </p>


        <h4 id = "three">Conclusion & Future Prospects<a href="#main_content_wrap">UP</a></h4>
        <p>From the first visualisation, if we click on "drug abuse" from the menu, we can notice a distinct jump in the number of suicides in Maharashtra as compared to the other states.
          To understand this trend I tried to visualise the suicides due to drug abuse in the top 5 states for every age group. To keep the data integrity intact, we can not directly look at the numbers as the population and size of each state is no factored in. Further, to understand this better,
          you can click on each state from the list and visualise them separately. I made the following analysis:
          <ul>
            <li>Kerala is the only state to have similar number of suicide cases from two age groups; 30-59.</li>
            <li>All states except kerala have a highest number of suicides in the age group 30-45.</li>
            <li>Maharashtra has the number of suicides related to drug abuse.</li>
          </ul>

          We can see from the listed points that there must be relationship between the age group of a person, their location and their reason to commit suicide. This helps in verifying my initial hypothesis.


        <h4 id = "four">Analysis #4: Relationship between type of suicide, gender and the age group. <a href="#main_content_wrap">UP</a></h4>
        <p>This specific visualisation show a stark difference between the number of male and female suicides in different states. Unlike other factors we can see that the age of the person concerned makes a difference to their likeliness to commit suicide. From this picture we can infer that:
          <ul>
            <li>In most cases, men of age 30-44 are most likely to commit suicide.</li>
            <li>Unlike the case of men, women of age 15-29 are most likely to commit suicide</li>
            <li>When it comes to love affairs, people of age 15-29 (Male and Female) show a higher tendency to commit suicide.</li>
          </ul>
          We can go on to conclude from this that different social issues affect people of varying age and gender differently.

        <h4 id = "five">Analysis #5: Other relationships to be analysed. <a href="#main_content_wrap">UP</a></h4>
        <p>These are some interesting observations I made while analysing the first visualisation which I feel can be further researched upon to understand the trends better.
        This leads to the scope of this project which can go deeper into any of the aforementioned niche topics and we could possibly come up with solutions for the same.</p>

        <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p>We have seen the data </p>

        <h4 id = "troubleshoot">TROUBLESHOOTING <a href="#main_content_wrap">UP</a></h4>
        <p> If you cannot view the visualisation from Tableau Public it is probably because you are not able to connect to their servers. This usually occurs with a number of wifi network because of their respective firewall settings. If this does not work using the Ashoka University wifi, please use mobile data or some other network to connect. If the problem still persists, please contact the owner of this website for further details.</p>
